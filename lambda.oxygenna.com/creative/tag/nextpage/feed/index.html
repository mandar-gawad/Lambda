				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized <strong>religion</strong>. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity.</p>
<p>Stan Lee never left. I&#8217;m afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; Fire can be our friend; whether it&#8217;s toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.</p>
<p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Look out, Itchy! He&#8217;s Irish! I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Slow down, Bart! My legs don&#8217;t know how to be as long as yours. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don&#8217;t work out in real life, uh, Christianity. I&#8217;ll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. How could you?! Haven&#8217;t you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn&#8217;t hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… I stand by my racial slur.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t give you gay, did he? Did he?! Homer no function beer well without. Get ready, skanks! It&#8217;s time for the truth train! You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</p>
<p>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico? Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!</p>
<p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that&#8217;s a *really* useful invention!</p>
<p>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</p>
