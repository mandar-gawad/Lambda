				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and <strong>Eskimos</strong>. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel <strong>Prize</strong> for attempted chemistry? Get ready, skanks! It&#8217;s time for the truth train! Books are useless! I only ever read one book, &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?</p>
<blockquote><p>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what <strong>separates</strong> us from the animals…except the weasel. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don&#8217;t work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Son, when you participate in sporting events, it&#8217;s not whether you win or lose: it&#8217;s how drunk you get. Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Homer no function beer well without. I stand by my racial slur. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</p>
<p>No children have ever meddled with the <strong>Republican</strong> Party and lived to tell about it. Homer no function beer well without. Ahoy hoy? We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Get ready, skanks! It&#8217;s time for the truth train!</p>

<p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; and it gave me <strong>absolutely</strong> no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity…</p>
