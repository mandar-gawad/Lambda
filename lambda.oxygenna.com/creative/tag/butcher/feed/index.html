<br /> Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare <strong>office</strong>? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!</p>
<p>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. The <strong>Internet</strong> King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</p>
<p><img src="http://d169hzb81ub7u3.cloudfront.net/creative/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/10/p041.jpg" alt="p04" width="1200" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-254" /></p>
<p>But, <strong>Aquaman</strong>, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You&#8217;re from two different worlds… Oh, I&#8217;ve wasted my life. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</p>
<p>Get ready, skanks! It&#8217;s time for the truth train! Your guilty consciences may make you vote <strong>Democratic</strong>, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! What good is money if it can&#8217;t inspire terror in your fellow man?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the <strong>Force</strong>. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several <strong>transmissions</strong> were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<ol>
<li>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight?</li>
<li>Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li>
</ol>
<p>Red Five standing by. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>He is here. Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
<blockquote><p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid. I call it luck. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re best at, ain&#8217;t it? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!?</p>
<p>Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly&hellip; I find your lack of faith disturbing. I find your lack of faith <strong>disturbing</strong>. I call it luck.</p>
