<p>Super <strong>squeaky</strong> bum time! You hit me with a cricket bat. You&#8217;ve swallowed a planet! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p></p>
<p>All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Father <strong>Christmas</strong>. Santa Claus. Or as I&#8217;ve always known him: Jeff. All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? They&#8217;re not aliens, they&#8217;re Earth&hellip;liens! All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Aw, you&#8217;re all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>

<p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there&#8217;s an escaped fish. You know when grown-ups tell you &#8216;everything&#8217;s going to be fine&#8217; and you think they&#8217;re probably lying to make you feel better? All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Aw, you&#8217;re all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They&#8217;re not aliens, they&#8217;re Earth&hellip;liens! Saving the world with meals on wheels.</p>
<p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I&#8217;ve always known him: Jeff. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I&#8217;ve always known him: Jeff. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don&#8217;t know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don&#8217;t know why. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No&hellip; It&#8217;s a thing; it&#8217;s like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>
<p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I&#8217;m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don&#8217;t know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;m the Doctor, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>I never loved you. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. And why did &#8216;I&#8217; have to take a cab? I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing. OK, if everyone&#8217;s finished being stupid.<br /> These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#8217;ll rest easier not knowing where they are. And until then, I can never die? We&#8217;re rescuing ya. Ugh, it&#8217;s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we&#8217;re at it? Michelle, I don&#8217;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
<p>Daddy Bender, we&#8217;re hungry. Morbo will now introduce tonight&#8217;s candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo&#8217;s good friend, Richard Nixon. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#8217;t own! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! &#8216;It is!&#8217; My precious torso! File not found.</p>
<p>You know, I was God once. Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>
