				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; and it gave me <strong>absolutely</strong> no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he&#8217;d eat you and everyone you care about! Stan Lee never left. I&#8217;m afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the <strong>animals</strong>…except the weasel. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. Dad didn&#8217;t leave… When he comes back from the <strong>store</strong>, he&#8217;s going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! Marge, just about everything&#8217;s a sin. Y&#8217;ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we&#8217;re not supposed to go to the bathroom. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</p>
<p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Fire can be our friend; whether it&#8217;s toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. And here I am <strong>using</strong> my own lungs like a sucker. &#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion.</p>
