				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is <strong>intelligent</strong>. Dissect its brain! It&#8217;s a T. It goes &#8220;tuh&#8221;. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Morbo will now introduce tonight&#8217;s candidates&hellip; Morbo&#8217;s good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Shut up and take my money! You know, I was God once. Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Pansy.</p>
<p>I never loved you. OK, if everyone&#8217;s finished being stupid. Oh Leela! You&#8217;re the only <strong>person</strong> I could turn to; you&#8217;re the only person who ever loved me. Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#8217;ll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Fetal stemcells, aren&#8217;t those controversial? I wish! It&#8217;s a nickel. I had more, but you go ahead. I was all of history&#8217;s great robot actors &#8211; Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, it&#8217;s 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can&#8217;t hold the charge and the reception isn&#8217;t very&hellip; Soon enough. We&#8217;re rescuing ya.</p>
<p>Stop it, stop it. It&#8217;s fine. I will &#8216;destroy&#8217; you! But existing is basically all I do! I usually try to keep my <strong>sadness</strong> pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. And why did &#8216;I&#8217; have to take a cab? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
<p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic <strong>beverages</strong>! Yeah, lots of people did. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Ugh, it&#8217;s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we&#8217;re at it?</p>
<p>Kif might! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Professor, make a woman out of me.</p>
