				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and <strong>Eskimos</strong>. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel <strong>Prize</strong> for attempted chemistry? Get ready, skanks! It&#8217;s time for the truth train! Books are useless! I only ever read one book, &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?</p>
<blockquote><p>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what <strong>separates</strong> us from the animals…except the weasel. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don&#8217;t work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Son, when you participate in sporting events, it&#8217;s not whether you win or lose: it&#8217;s how drunk you get. Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Homer no function beer well without. I stand by my racial slur. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</p>
<p>No children have ever meddled with the <strong>Republican</strong> Party and lived to tell about it. Homer no function beer well without. Ahoy hoy? We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Get ready, skanks! It&#8217;s time for the truth train!</p>

<p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; and it gave me <strong>absolutely</strong> no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is <strong>intelligent</strong>. Dissect its brain! It&#8217;s a T. It goes &#8220;tuh&#8221;. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Morbo will now introduce tonight&#8217;s candidates&hellip; Morbo&#8217;s good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Shut up and take my money! You know, I was God once. Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Pansy.</p>
<p>I never loved you. OK, if everyone&#8217;s finished being stupid. Oh Leela! You&#8217;re the only <strong>person</strong> I could turn to; you&#8217;re the only person who ever loved me. Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#8217;ll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Fetal stemcells, aren&#8217;t those controversial? I wish! It&#8217;s a nickel. I had more, but you go ahead. I was all of history&#8217;s great robot actors &#8211; Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, it&#8217;s 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can&#8217;t hold the charge and the reception isn&#8217;t very&hellip; Soon enough. We&#8217;re rescuing ya.</p>
<p>Stop it, stop it. It&#8217;s fine. I will &#8216;destroy&#8217; you! But existing is basically all I do! I usually try to keep my <strong>sadness</strong> pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. And why did &#8216;I&#8217; have to take a cab? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
<p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic <strong>beverages</strong>! Yeah, lots of people did. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Ugh, it&#8217;s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we&#8217;re at it?</p>
<p>Kif might! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Professor, make a woman out of me.</p>

<br /> I hate yogurt. It&#8217;s just stuff with bits in. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there&#8217;s an escaped <strong>fish</strong>. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a <strong>football</strong> match, didn&#8217;t you? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don&#8217;t always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don&#8217;t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the <strong>Doctor</strong>, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there&#8217;s an escaped fish.

<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don&#8217;t lie to me! Stop talking, <strong>brain</strong> thinking. Hush. You know when grown-ups tell you &#8216;everything&#8217;s going to be fine&#8217; and you think they&#8217;re probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
<p>Aw, you&#8217;re all Mr. Grumpy Face today. All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Aw, you&#8217;re all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>

I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m nobody&#8217;s taxi service; I&#8217;m not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. You all right, Dexter? Like a sloth. I can do that. I&#8217;m a sociopath; there&#8217;s not much he can do for me. You&#8217;re a killer. I catch killers. I&#8217;m not the monster he wants me to be. So I&#8217;m neither man nor beast. I&#8217;m <strong>something</strong> new entirely. With my own set of rules. I&#8217;m Dexter. Boo.</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. He taught me a code. To survive. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I&#8217;m not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>I am not a killer. Under normal circumstances, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. You&#8217;re a killer. I catch killers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before. Like a sloth. I can do that. Makes me a &hellip; scientist. I&#8217;m a sociopath; there&#8217;s not much he can do for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>God created pudding, and then he rested.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
<li>Tonight&#8217;s the night. And it&#8217;s going to happen again and again. It has to happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks. Makes me a &hellip; scientist. Keep your mind limber. Makes me a &hellip; scientist.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m partial to air conditioning. Under normal circumstances, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment. You look&hellip;perfect. Keep your mind limber. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I&#8217;m not even sure what the picture should be. I&#8217;m thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?</p>

<p>I never loved you. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. And why did &#8216;I&#8217; have to take a cab? I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing. OK, if everyone&#8217;s finished being stupid.<br /> These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#8217;ll rest easier not knowing where they are. And until then, I can never die? We&#8217;re rescuing ya. Ugh, it&#8217;s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we&#8217;re at it? Michelle, I don&#8217;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
<p>Daddy Bender, we&#8217;re hungry. Morbo will now introduce tonight&#8217;s candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo&#8217;s good friend, Richard Nixon. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#8217;t own! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! &#8216;It is!&#8217; My precious torso! File not found.</p>
<p>You know, I was God once. Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>
