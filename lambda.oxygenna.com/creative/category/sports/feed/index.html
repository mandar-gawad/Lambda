<p>I never loved you. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. And why did &#8216;I&#8217; have to take a cab? I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing. OK, if everyone&#8217;s finished being stupid.<br /> These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#8217;ll rest easier not knowing where they are. And until then, I can never die? We&#8217;re rescuing ya. Ugh, it&#8217;s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we&#8217;re at it? Michelle, I don&#8217;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
<p>Daddy Bender, we&#8217;re hungry. Morbo will now introduce tonight&#8217;s candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo&#8217;s good friend, Richard Nixon. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#8217;t own! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! &#8216;It is!&#8217; My precious torso! File not found.</p>
<p>You know, I was God once. Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>
