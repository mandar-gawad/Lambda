<p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! It&#8217;s just like the story of the <strong>grasshopper</strong> and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. So, how &#8217;bout them <strong>Knicks</strong>? I saw you with those two &#8220;ladies of the evening&#8221; at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
<p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s a T. It goes &#8220;tuh&#8221;. Pansy. How much did you make me? Fatal.</p>

<p>I never loved you. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. And why did &#8216;I&#8217; have to take a cab? I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing. OK, if everyone&#8217;s finished being stupid.<br /> These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#8217;ll rest easier not knowing where they are. And until then, I can never die? We&#8217;re rescuing ya. Ugh, it&#8217;s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we&#8217;re at it? Michelle, I don&#8217;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
<p>Daddy Bender, we&#8217;re hungry. Morbo will now introduce tonight&#8217;s candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo&#8217;s good friend, Richard Nixon. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#8217;t own! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! &#8216;It is!&#8217; My precious torso! File not found.</p>
<p>You know, I was God once. Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the <strong>Force</strong>. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several <strong>transmissions</strong> were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<ol>
<li>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight?</li>
<li>Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li>
</ol>
<p>Red Five standing by. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>He is here. Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
<blockquote><p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid. I call it luck. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re best at, ain&#8217;t it? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!?</p>
<p>Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly&hellip; I find your lack of faith disturbing. I find your lack of faith <strong>disturbing</strong>. I call it luck.</p>
<p>Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
