				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized <strong>religion</strong>. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity.</p>
<p>Stan Lee never left. I&#8217;m afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; Fire can be our friend; whether it&#8217;s toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.</p>
<p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Look out, Itchy! He&#8217;s Irish! I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Slow down, Bart! My legs don&#8217;t know how to be as long as yours. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don&#8217;t work out in real life, uh, Christianity. I&#8217;ll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. How could you?! Haven&#8217;t you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn&#8217;t hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… I stand by my racial slur.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t give you gay, did he? Did he?! Homer no function beer well without. Get ready, skanks! It&#8217;s time for the truth train! You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</p>
<p>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico? Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!</p>
<p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that&#8217;s a *really* useful invention!</p>
<p>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; and it gave me <strong>absolutely</strong> no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he&#8217;d eat you and everyone you care about! Stan Lee never left. I&#8217;m afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the <strong>animals</strong>…except the weasel. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. Dad didn&#8217;t leave… When he comes back from the <strong>store</strong>, he&#8217;s going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! Marge, just about everything&#8217;s a sin. Y&#8217;ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we&#8217;re not supposed to go to the bathroom. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</p>
<p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Fire can be our friend; whether it&#8217;s toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. And here I am <strong>using</strong> my own lungs like a sucker. &#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary <strong>human</strong> being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I hate yogurt. It&#8217;s just stuff with bits in. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there&#8217;s an escaped fish.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You know when grown-ups tell you &#8216;everything&#8217;s going to be fine&#8217; and you think they&#8217;re probably lying to make you feel better? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! No&hellip; It&#8217;s a thing; it&#8217;s like a plan, but with more greatness. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I&#8217;ve always known him: Jeff. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I&#8217;m a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>
<blockquote><p>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I&#8217;m a normal <strong>bloke</strong>, tell me what normal blokes do! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I&#8217;m the Doctor, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? It&#8217;s a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</p>
<p>I hate yogurt. It&#8217;s just stuff with bits in. I&#8217;m nobody&#8217;s taxi service; I&#8217;m not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>
<ol>
<li>Saving the world with meals on wheels.</li>
<li>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</li>
<li>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don&#8217;t always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don&#8217;t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</li>

<p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s art!

<p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! It&#8217;s just like the story of the <strong>grasshopper</strong> and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. So, how &#8217;bout them <strong>Knicks</strong>? I saw you with those two &#8220;ladies of the evening&#8221; at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
<p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s a T. It goes &#8220;tuh&#8221;. Pansy. How much did you make me? Fatal.</p>
