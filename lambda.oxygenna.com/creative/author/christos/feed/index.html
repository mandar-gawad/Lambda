				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. You all right, Dexter? Like a sloth. I can do that. I&#8217;m a sociopath; there&#8217;s not much he can do for me. You&#8217;re a killer. I catch killers. I&#8217;m not the monster he wants me to be. So I&#8217;m neither man nor beast. I&#8217;m <strong>something</strong> new entirely. With my own set of rules. I&#8217;m Dexter. Boo.</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. He taught me a code. To survive. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I&#8217;m not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>I am not a killer. Under normal circumstances, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. You&#8217;re a killer. I catch killers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before. Like a sloth. I can do that. Makes me a &hellip; scientist. I&#8217;m a sociopath; there&#8217;s not much he can do for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>God created pudding, and then he rested.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
<li>Tonight&#8217;s the night. And it&#8217;s going to happen again and again. It has to happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks. Makes me a &hellip; scientist. Keep your mind limber. Makes me a &hellip; scientist.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m partial to air conditioning. Under normal circumstances, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment. You look&hellip;perfect. Keep your mind limber. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I&#8217;m not even sure what the picture should be. I&#8217;m thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the <strong>Force</strong>. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several <strong>transmissions</strong> were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<ol>
<li>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight?</li>
<li>Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li>
</ol>
<p>Red Five standing by. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>He is here. Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
<blockquote><p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid. I call it luck. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re best at, ain&#8217;t it? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!?</p>
<p>Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly&hellip; I find your lack of faith disturbing. I find your lack of faith <strong>disturbing</strong>. I call it luck.</p>
